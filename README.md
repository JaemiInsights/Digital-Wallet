# Digital-Wallet Dashboard
This project shows how I analyzed and visualized a **Digital Wallet dataset** from Kaggle.

## Tools used
- **Excel** : Data Cleaning
- **SQL (MySQL)** : Deep Analysis
- **Power BI** : Visuals & Dashboard

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harunrai/digital-wallet-transactions)

## Process
1. **Cleaned data in Excel**
   - Created a duplicate file before cleaning to preserve the original dataset
   - Removed duplicates in the dataset
   - Filtered column headers
   - Used TEXT to Column function in the Data tab to seperate the transaction date from time
   - Edited all columns into proper format
   - Deleted unwanted columns
   - Inserted a new column 'Month' and used the TEXT function to extract just the month from the transaction date
2. **Analyzed in SQL**

3. **Visualized in Power BI**
   - KPIs (Total Transactions, Total Revenue, Average Revenue, No of active users)
   - Line Chart: monthly trend, monthly active users
   - Bar Chart: revenue by device, transaction by device
   - Pie Chart: location revenue
   - Donut Chart: payment method revenue
